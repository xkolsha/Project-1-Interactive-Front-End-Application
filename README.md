# Project 1: Interactive Front-End Application

## Description

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in their own context. This project is an interactive web application that uses TheColorAPI to generate colour palettes based on user-selected colours. The application helps designers and artists to create harmonious colour schemes for their artworks, designs, or any colour-related projects.

## How to Complete the Challenge

- The URL of the deployed application. This will be the link where your application is live and accessible on the web.
- The URL of the GitHub repository that contains your code. Make sure to give your repository a unique name that reflects the nature of the project. Include a README file in your repository that describes the project, its functionality, and how to use it.
